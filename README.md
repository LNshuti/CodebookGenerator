# codebook
This is a simple R codebook generator. It produces a rmarkdown document that can be knit into an HTML document.

Project took a lot of inspiration (along with some helper functions) from the makeCodebook() function in the dataMaid package. But I'd wanted to create my own codebook generator for a while, and I didn't like how dataMaid handled categorical variables, so here we are.
